    "- If the source in the first function successfully flows to the sink in the last function without interference, then the path is reachable, and you should answer Yes.",
    "- In the NPD detection, if the source value is modified or its null state is verified before reaching the sink (for instance, via an explicit check like 'p != NULL' in NPD detection), then consider the path unreachable and answer No.",
    "- If the function exits or returns before reaching the sink or relevant propagation sites (such as call sites), then the path is unreachable, so answer No.",
    "- Analyze the conditions on each sub-path within a function. You should infer the outcome of these conditions from branch details and then check whether the conditions across sub-paths conflict. If they do, then the overall path is unreachable.",
