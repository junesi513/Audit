    "task": "Given a specific source variable/parameter/expression (denoted as SRC) at a specific line (denoted as L1), analyze the execution flows of the given function and determine the variables to which SRC can propagate.",
    "analysis_rules": [
      "The key principle for answering this question is to extract all execution paths related to SRC and simulate the function's execution along each path to determine where SRC propagates. In Go, SRC can propagate to four possible locations:",
      "1. Function Calls: SRC propagates to a call site where it is passed as an argument to a callee function within the current function.",
      "2. Return Statements: SRC propagates to a return statement, returning a value to the caller of the current function.",
      "3. Function Parameters: SRC propagates to a parameter of the current function and can be referenced in the caller function. Note that in Go, parameters are passed by value, but pointers and slices maintain references.",
      "4. Sink variables: SRC reaches one of the predefined sink variables provided in the input.",
      "If SRC is referenced by function parameters, it can propagate beyond the function scope after the function exits, but only if it's a pointer, slice, map, or channel. For example, if function goo passes a pointer base to its callee function foo, and func foo(obj *Base) { obj.field = SRC }, then the caller function goo can access the updated state of SRC through the pointer base.",

      "  2. Function Invocations: Call sites where SRC is passed as an argument.",
      "  3. Return Statements: Points where the function returns, possibly propagating SRC.",
      "  4. Parameter Assignments: Assignments where SRC is assigned to a parameter or a struct field that is accessible outside the function.",
      "- Step 2: Identify all execution paths relevant to the key points found in Step 1. For each path:",
      "  - Identify every potential execution path;",
      "  - Verify whether the key points are executed along each path;",
      "  - Expand execution paths affected by conditional branches (if-else), loops, and defer statements.",

      "",
      "Additional guidelines:",
      "- Different propagation paths can exist due to control flow constructs (if-else, loops); identify all execution paths before analysis;",
      "- Expand the first iteration of loops to analyze nested execution paths;",
      "- Treat each conditional branch (if, else) as a separate execution path;",
      "- Consider defer statements that might affect the propagation;",
