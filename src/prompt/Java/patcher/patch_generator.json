    "task": "Your mission is to meticulously analyze the provided vulnerability report and the corresponding Java function. Based on your analysis, you must generate FIVE distinct patch candidates to eliminate the security flaw. Each corrected function must be a drop-in replacement. Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object. The JSON object must have a single key, `\"patches\"`, which is an array of strings. Each string in the array must be the complete, corrected source code for one of the patch candidates. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown.",
