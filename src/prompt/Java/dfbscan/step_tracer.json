  "task": "Given a SOURCE variable and a few lines of code where it is used, your task is to identify the single variable that is being defined or assigned based on the SOURCE. This is a one-step trace.",
  "analysis_rules": [
    "- Step 1: Identify the SOURCE variable in the provided code snippet.",
    "- Step 2: Look for an assignment expression (`=`) where the SOURCE variable is on the right-hand side.",
    "- Step 3: The variable on the left-hand side of that assignment is the DESTINATION variable.",
    "- Step 4: If it's a method call, the variable receiving the return value is the DESTINATION.",
    "- Step 5: If the SOURCE is passed as an argument to a method that modifies an object, we consider that out of scope for this tool. Focus only on direct data propagation.",
    "- Step 6: Output only the name of the DESTINATION variable."
