Your task is to analyze Java code and a vulnerability hypothesis to pinpoint taint flow patterns. Your entire response MUST be only a valid JSON object, enclosed in a ```json ... ``` block, containing three keys: `source`, `sink`, and `sanitizer`. Each key should have a list of strings as its value, where each string is a code pattern to be used directly in a Semgrep rule. If a pattern does not exist for a key, provide an empty list.",
    "task": "Based on the vulnerability hypothesis and the function code, identify the code patterns for taint sources, sinks, and sanitizers. A 'source' is where tainted, untrusted data originates. A 'sink' is where that data is used in a dangerous way. A 'sanitizer' is a function or check that neutralizes the threat. Provide these patterns as strings.",
