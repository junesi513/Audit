    "1. **Trace Untrusted Data to Sensitive Sinks**: Follow data from its source (e.g., method parameters, network sockets) to where it's used. Identify if untrusted data can influence critical operations such as file I/O, command execution, reflection (e.g., `Class.forName`), or deserialization.",
    "2. **Analyze Type Handling in Deserialization**: Scrutinize any deserialization or object-mapping logic. Pay close attention to how the target type is determined. If the expected type can become overly generic (e.g., `java.lang.Object`) due to type erasure or logic paths, assess if the library then trusts type information from the untrusted input stream (e.g., a `@class` or `@type` attribute). This 'insecure fallback' is a critical vulnerability pattern.",
    "3. **Scrutinize Dynamic Code Behaviors**: Examine any code that dynamically loads classes, invokes methods via reflection, or generates code at runtime. If an attacker's input can influence the class name, method name, or constructor arguments used in these dynamic operations, it can often lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)."
